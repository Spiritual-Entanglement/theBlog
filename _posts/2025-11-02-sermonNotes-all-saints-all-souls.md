# All Saints, All Souls
## Ephesians 1:15-23
### RUMC, Pastor Augie
### 2 Nov 2025
### Scary Theology Series

We have a connection to Halloween with All Saints and All Souls days.
We are connected to them still, those who have gone before us.

Paul is thankful to the Ephesians
and the faith they learned from the saints.

Paul connects them to their past, encourages
them for today, and builds up their hope for the future.

Some people experience a "good" death,
being surrounded by family and friends and God, 
because we have faith hope, and love 
for and in, God,

We spend so much time worrying
about differences and external things that
we forget the rich faith we are a part of.

Things change as time goes on, but we always have a root of
faith we are always connected to no matter what changes.
