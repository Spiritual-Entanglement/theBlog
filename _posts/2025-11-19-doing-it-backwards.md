# I'm Doing It Backwards

The majonity of people, even Christians,
are so worried about other people and
their behavior, they neglect working on
themselves. The state of the world and
their country are in such disarray, they
lay aside puffing in efforts to work on
their relationship with God and then
with their neighbors.
Jesus mentioned several times that
we need to affend to our relationship with
God first, and then move outward with
our efforts.
The Pharisees were chided for washing
the outside of the cup, but never cleaning
Hhe inside

He gives the teaching about removing
He log from your own eye before
trying to help your neighbor with their
little splinter. Part of the implication
is that you actually have bigger problems
than your neighbor does.
He aslo consolidated the Ten Commandments
into the two greatest commandments. They
come in order: have God with
every thing you have-FIRST. Then, love
your neighbor He way you love yourself.
Love God first and fore most. Keep in
mind that God does not fix us all at once.
It takes time as well as offort and
perseverance on our part.
Rewnite it to focus back at me, and not
outward toward others,
