Harry Potter, Halloween, and being a Christian..

"Stop trying to scare people into Heaven,
and love the Hell out of them."

Harry Potter series, The uproar around
it when it first came out. Why was there
such a huge uproar?

Some Scripture we can read talks
very strongly against witchcraft.

The Dunning-Kruger Effect.
"Trust me it's complicated."
First is this peak of over - confidence because we have found a
little bit of information, we think we know everything.

The witch hunts: "They didn't burn witches; they burned women!"

William Tindale was burned for translating
the Bible into English

When Eminem came out his (Pastor Augie's) parents
had him read the lyrics, and asked
him what is good and bad in those lyrics?

How many people read Harry Potter before condemning it?

Just rejecting things off the cuff has not worked
out well for the church.

We have a habit of not discerning things thoroughly.

We need to ask questions.
We need to ask God where are YOU in this?
What can we celebrate, and what do we need to leave behind?

YES, there are things that are bad for us.

But, without prayerful discernment,and
use of reason, we can jump to conclusions
that are harmful and very dangerous.
