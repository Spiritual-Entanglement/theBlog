Ephesians 1:15-23
We have a connection to Halloween
with All Saints and All souls days.
We are connected to those, still, those
who have gone before us.
Pawl is thanfiful to the Ephesians
and the faith they learned from the saints.
Panl connects them to their past, encourase
them for today, and build up their
hope for the future.
Some people experience a "good" death,
being surrounded by family and friends
and God, Because we have faith hope,
and love for and in, God,
We spend so much time wonrying
about differences and exfernal things that
we forget the rich fouth we are a
part of it,
Things change as time goes on,
but we always have a root of
faith we are always connected to
if no matter what changes.
