# My Real Joy


My real joy is how my relationship with
God has blossomed over the last few
years. Ever since I started to make a
more concerted effort to know God, He
has responded to my persistent efforts.

I did not know it was truly possible
to feel God's presence in my daily life
beyond just intillectual knowledge, but
to truly feel God is around me at all
fimes.

From the start it is evident that God
has been slowly guiding my growth and
formation. It seems clear that God is
not demanding I become perfect all at
onee, but we work together to affect
my continval growth and formation. I
only have to be persistent and work the
next task. He is asking me to pay attention to.
It all seems to stew, at least from
my and of the relationship, my willingness
to go to God persistently several times a
day in various ways: formal & informal prayer,
reading, contemplating, and, now, via writing.
