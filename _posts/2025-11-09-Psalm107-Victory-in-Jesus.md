# Psalm 107: Victory in Jesus

Even before Jesus Christ shows up
this Psalm talks about our inability to
keep God's (or anyone's) laws by our
own willpower and effort.

For those who think, in their pride
and puffed-up ego, they are fully in
control, and can do everything by their
own power and effort -- they will be
left to their own devices, and allowed
to try it.

But, "Some lay in darkness and
gloom, prisoners in misery and chains,
having defied the words of God."

God will leave you to suffer the
consequences of your actions if you
do not want Him in your life. Look
at the chains of slavery that
bind you to your sins.

*Sins are addictive.*

"Then they cried to the Lord in their
distress. He led them forth from darkness
and gloom and broke their chains to
pieces."

Those who truly call on, and desire God,
will be saved, ***Jesus's death on the Cross
broke the ability of sin to keep us in
chains*** -- in slavery to sin.

It is amazing that scripture talks of this
in the Psalms: the victory Jesus will win
for us by His death on the Cross.

But you have to exercise this victory. You
have to choose the victory.

*Sin is an addictive slavery.*

Following Jesus is not addictive;
it is freedom -- freedom to choose
the path you will take. That is
your free will in action; you make the choice.
If you choose to follow sin (pride,
pleasure, power) God will leave you to it.
You will reap what you sow.

If you choose to follow Christ, God is
right there ready to help you. He will
lead and guide you as much as you want.
God likes and wants you to ask for His help.
God's help comes through many channels.
Your spiritual life is like a muscle: you
have to exercise it to make it stronger
and more sensitive to His leading.
God normally works through other Christians
in our life, especially when we are in
spiritually weakened states.
