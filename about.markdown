# YARB - Yet Another Religious Blog.

## WHY?!
It just will not get out of my head, that I need to keep some notes in a publicly accessible space.  I do not know 'WHY' I have this internal drive.  Honestly, I will be surprised if anyone reads it, and writing like this feels like false modestly and a bit arrogant.

## Who?
- Dave.
- I am a lay member of a United Methodist Church.
- I am the son of an Elder in full connection in the United Methodist Church.  My Dad passed away in Nov of 2020 -- not from Covid.  My Mom is still with us. As far as I know, she has been a Methodist all of her life.
- I became a Christian in 9th grade.  I deeply desired to grow in relationship to Jesus Christ.
- I wanted to be a monk.
  - Had I been Catholic, I probably would have seriously pursued a vocation with a religious order.
  - I probably would have gone on to become a priest in that order.
- I could not find anyone to really teach me how to grow spiritually.
  - So, I read a ton of books about the Christian life.
    - Unfortunately, the ones that might have helped me were wasted because
      1. They were way over my head.
      1. I could not find any person with experience enough to explain them to me.
  - IHMO, I think the protestant churches have lost the knowledge and ability to help Christians grow in their spiritual formation.
- While Methodist, I have very Catholic beliefs and spiritual practices.
  - I make use of Catholic prayers and other things from the Catholic tradition.
    - I call them "spiritual tools."
  - I think Catholics threw the baby out with the Pope, to our great detriment.
  - Catholic spirituality is the ***ONLY*** thing that has ever helped me progress in my spiritual formation, and resulted in a deep relationship with God.
    - **THE. ONLY. THING.**
- Pope Leo XIV is awesome!!

## What?
- I intend to collect here, thoughts and notes I don't want to lose.
- The point is for them to be accessible where ever I am.
- The posts are expected to be short and to the point.
- I'm not interested in debating, so there is no comment section.

## What do I believe?
### [Apostile's Creed][apostles-creed] says it all
> I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br />
Creator of heaven and earth,<br />
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,<br />
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,<br />
born of the Virgin Mary,<br />
suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br />
was crucified, died and was buried;<br />
He descended into hell;<br />
on the third day He rose again from the dead;<br />
He ascended into heaven,<br />
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;<br />
from thence He shall come to judge the quick and the dead.<br />
-<br />
I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br />
the holy catholic Church,<br />
the communion of saints,<br />
the forgiveness of sins,<br />
the resurrection of the body,<br />
and life everlasting.<br />
-<br />
Amen.
