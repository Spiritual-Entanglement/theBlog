# My Real Joy


My real joy is how my relationship with
God has blossomed over the last few
years. Ever since I started to make a
more concerted effort to know God, He
has responded to my persistence.

I did not know it was truly possible
to feel God's presence in my daily life,
beyond just intellectual knowledge, but
to truly feel God is around me at all
times.

From the start it is evident that God
has been slowly guiding my growth and
formation. It seems clear that God is
not demanding I become perfect all at
once, but we work together to affect
my continual growth and formation. I
only have to be persistent and work the
next task He is asking me to pay attention to.
It all seems to stem, at least from
my end of the relationship, from my willingness
to go to God persistently several times a
day in various ways: formal & informal prayer,
reading, contemplating, and, now, via writing.
