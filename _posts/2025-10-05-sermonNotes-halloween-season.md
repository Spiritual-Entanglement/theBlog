How can we panticipate in this
season with holiness.
Postor Ausie's early years, before 9:
Hhey used to go to a Hell house versus a
haunted house. They are designed to scare
He "hell" out of you, "Is your name
writfen in the book of life?"
Many chorches operate this way: the
object is to scare you into being a good
Christian.
We take the book of Revelation and
crowbar it into a twentieth century world.
In the text, Joha says that "death" and
"hades are thrown into the lake of Fire. They
are burned up and done gone, consumed.
Much of our current ideas of Hell
are influenced by art much of if

comes from fictional works. Many of these
works add to, or build extra things int the
scripture,
Many of these works are used to scare
people in to Heaven. They are using fear to
proclaim te Gospel, the "Good News" of
Jesus Christ.
It is harder to follow Jesus, the Christ.
We use Pear because if seems easier to
scare Hhem,
Those who called on the name of the LORD,
but used it to cause harm to their others.
There will people who call on the name of
the hoRD, but He never knew Hem.
Is Hell real? Well, there is somethins..
We should be sharing our joy.
