The majority of people, even Christians, are so worried about other people and their behavior, they neglect working on themselves.  I believe our thought is like this: "I need to fix the outside world, and I will
get back to myself later."  That is, **IF** I think there is anything about myself that needs work or fixing.  The tendency is for me to think my mental and emotional health is just fine the way it is; "most well adjusted, normal people, think almost the same way I do.  Therefore, it is only maladjusted people who think wrongly.  I am perfectly sane and normal, so I don't really have any problems that need attention."

Since the state of the world and my country are in such disarray, I tend to lay aside efforts to work on my relationship with God and then with my neighbors.  "I have to fix the world first!"

I think this is actually normal.  As a parent, I want to help my child first, to make sure he or she is cared for, and then worry about myself.  We take care of our guests first before we make ourselves comfortable.  This is normal.

But, when it comes to my relationship with God, and my relationship with the rest of the world, maybe I have been looking at it backwards: I want to fix everyone else first.  I want to tell everyone else how they should fix themselves.

Maybe I should fix myself first.

It is the same principle on a plane: put your airmask on first, and then help your neighbor if they are struggling.

### Dirty Dishes
Jesus mentioned several times that I need to attend to our relationship with God first, and then move outward with my efforts.
The Pharisees were chided for washing the outside of the cup, but never cleaning the inside.

[Matthew 23:25-28](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/MAT.23.WEBUS)<br />
> 25 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and unrighteousness.  26 You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the platter, that its outside may become clean also."
27 “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!  For you are like whitened tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but inwardly are full of dead men’s bones and of all uncleanness.  28 Even so, you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity."

[Luke 11:39](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/LUK.11.WEBUS)

### Blind Helpers
Jesus gives a teaching about removing the log from my own eye before
trying to help my neighbor with their little splinter or speck.  Part of the implication is that I might actually have bigger problems than my neighbor does.

[Matthew 7:3-5](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/MAT.7.WEBUS)<br />
> 3 Why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but don’t consider the beam that is in your own eye?  4 Or how will you tell your brother, ‘Let me remove the speck from your eye,’ and behold, the beam is in your own eye?  5 You hypocrite!  First, remove the beam out of your own eye, and then you can see clearly to remove the speck out of your brother’s eye.

### The Greatest Commandment
He also consolidated the Ten Commandments into the two greatest commandments.  They come in order:
1.  Love God with everything you have.
2.  Then, love your neighbor the way you love yourself.

[Matthew 22:34-40](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/MAT.22.WEBUS)<br />
> 34 But the Pharisees, when they heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered themselves together.  35 One of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, testing him.  36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?”
37 Jesus said to him, “‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the first and great commandment.  39 A second likewise is this, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 The whole law and the prophets depend on these two commandments.”

[Mark 12:28-34](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/MRK.12.WEBUS), [Luke 10:25-28](https://www.bible.com/bible/206/LUK.10.WEBUS)

### Correct Orientation
Maybe I should submit myself to God, and allow Him to start fixing me first, before I worry about everyone else.

Love God first and foremost.

I do not think that God fixes me all at once.  It is going to take time, perseverance, and obedience (on my part) for God to unwind the tangle and knots of sin.  This is a topic for another day.  This cleaning of the inside of the cup is ***ONLY*** accomplished by the grace and mercy of God, but I have to show up and do the work He gives me.  (Slavery to sin and how the chain that binds me to it was and is broken in my personal life will be dealt with in another series of posts.)

So, I need to begin the process (yes, it is a process, not an instant fix) of getting myself right with God before I can go fix all the world's problems.  But I think if everyone worked on themselves and their relationship with God, we might be too busy to have all these problems.  So, suppose I concentrate on living the two greatest commandments.  In that case, I believe I would outwardly act like the solution  I would desire to see in others.

But, **HOW**?  That will be answered in other posts...
