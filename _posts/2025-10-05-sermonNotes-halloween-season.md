# Hell House
### RUMC: Pastor Augie
### 5 Oct 2025
### Scary Theology Series
How can we participate in this
season with holiness.
Pastor Augie's early years, before 9:
they used to go to a "Hell house" instead of a
haunted house. They are designed to scare
the "hell" out of you, "Is your name
written in the book of life?"

Hell houses were operated by churches.

Many churches operate this way: the
object is to scare you into being a good
Christian.

"Stop trying to scare people into Heaven,
and love the Hell out of them."


We take the book of Revelation and
crowbar it into a twentieth century world.
In the text, John says that "death" and
"hades" are thrown into the lake of Fire. They
are burned up and done.  Gone.  Consumed.

Much of our current ideas of Hell
are influenced by art.  Much of that comes
from fictional works. Many of these
works add to, or build extra things into the
scripture.

Many of these works are used to *scare*
people into Heaven. They are using fear to
proclaim the Gospel, the "Good News" of Jesus Christ.

It is harder to follow Jesus, the Christ.
We use fear because it just seems easier to
scare people.

There were those who called on the name of the LORD,
but used it to cause harm to their others.  There will
people who call on the name of the Lord,
but He never knew Hem.

Is Hell real? Well, there is something..

We should be sharing our joy; not trying to scare people.
