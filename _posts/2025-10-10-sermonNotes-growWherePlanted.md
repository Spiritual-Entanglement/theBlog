# Grow where you are planted.
## Jeremiah 29:14-7
### RUMC: Pastor Augie
### 11 Oct 2025
### Scary Theology Series
Jer 29:11 I plan to prosper you.
To the exiles --

Jeremiah is opposing another letter that is circulating.

Jeremiah tell the Israelites in captivity to go plant crops, have kids, and build
families -- wherever you are… Pray for the people and place where you find yourself.

The other letter is saying you will return to Jerusalem soon.

Jeremiah is saying it may not happen in your lifetime.

Even your kids may not get to go back to Jerusalem.

He says that GOD is saying, to live your life where you are.
Have kids, build houses, build family, build communities and culture.

Pray for where you are: the society, culture, government, etc.
Pray that it will be peaceful, prosper, and support the community.

Stop hoping on something that may or not happen, with so much energy
and depth that it interrupts daily life
to the point that you are not present
in your daily life.

God is telling them to not put so much
energy in the"not yet" and "no longer."
Live where you are; live in your daily circumstances.
You are where you are.

There is gratitude, praise, and thanks to be had where you are.

Grow where you are planted; God shows up wherever you are.
