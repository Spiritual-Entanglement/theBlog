Psaim 107
Even before Jesus Christ shows up
this Psalm talks about our inability to
keep God's, or anyone's , laws by our
own willpower and effort.
For those who think, in their pride
and poffed-up ego, they are fully in
control and can do everything by their
own power and effort -- they will be
left to their own devices, and allowed
to try if.
But, "Some lay in darkness and
gloom, prisoners in misery and chains,
having defied the words of God.
God will leave you to suffer the
consequences of your actions if you
do not want Him in your life. Look
at the chains of slavery that
bind you to your sins.
Sins are adictive.
"Then they cried to te LoRD in their
distress. He led them forth from darkness
and gloom and broke their chains to
pieces."
Those who truly call on, and desire God,
will be saved, Jesus' death on the Cross
broke the ability of sin to keep us in
chains - in slavery to sin.
It is amazing that scripture talks of this
in the Psalms - the victony Jesus will win
for us by His death on the Cross.
But you have to exercise this victory. You
have to choose if, Sin is an addictive
slavery. Following Jesus is not addictive;
it is freedom-Greedom to choose
the path you will take. That
your free will; you make the choice.
If you choose to follow sin (pride,
pleasure, power, God will leave you to it.
You will reap what you sow.
If you choose to follow Christ, God is
right there ready to help you. He will
lead and guide you as much as you want
God likes and wants you to ask for His help.
God's help comes through many channels.
Your spirifual life is like a muscle-you
have to exercise if to make it stronger
and more sensifive to God's leading.
God normally works through the othe Christans
in our life, especially when we are in
spirifually weakened states.
