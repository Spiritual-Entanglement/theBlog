# Where Does Individual Responsibility Lie

I have been thinking a lot about how God can be so loving, and yet allow individuals to be condemned in the afterlife.

Ever since I started to draw near to God in prayer on a consistent basis, I have been able to see His hand in my life on so many levels.  God's movement in my life is so much clearer, and more sure then mere coincidence.  But that is not the point of this entry.  I mention it to attest that as I desire an ever-closer relationship with God, God responds and draws near to me.  I just have to make the merest beginning of a step toward God, and He is right there already.

The more I demonstrate to God that I desire to be close to Him, and especially have my spirit and character formed by Him: to grow in Christ-likeness, to become more like Jesus, the more I find God helping me work on it.  And we are not working on everything at once, but working on a couple things at a time before moving on to something else.  I need to write this out in another entry.

So what about people who never, or don't want, to think of God, even if they do so out of ignorance or misinformation?

Free will must come into play here.  If I show no interest in God, He will not force me.  But, I will be required to live with the consequence.  God will continue to give me opportunities to respond to Him: Wesley's idea of Prevenient Grace, which says that God is always calling or drawing us to Him.  The idea of Jesus standing and knocking on the door of our heart, but never forcing entry.  *WE* must be the one that opens the door and freely asks God to enter in.

I think many of the arguments around how much is enough have partially centered around this point: is just inviting God in the door enough?  Do it once, and you no longer have to worry about it?

I think many Christians expect that all formation and growth happen and are completed as soon as we invite God in.  They expect, specifically, that if you **TRULY** have invited God into your life/heart/spirit/whatever, then you will be immediately transformed into Christ-likeness, and you will be immediately free from all current sin, temptation, and have all the virtues and fruits-of-the-Spirit fully formed in you from that point until you die.  I have never met *anyone* who seems to have had this happen in their life.

If *they* tell you it happened to them, then they need a humility check, and that is proof enough to me that they are misled.  Not condemned, not "unsaved," but misled about how God effects growth and change in our heart and spirit, and therefore our outward expression of life.

So what about people that do not ever seem to want to have anything to do with God or Jesus or church, etc.?

Is that the point where God allows them to make their choice and they will face that decision when they die?

God did not write instructions for us to follow initially.  Adam was not created and handed the Bible.  

I **DO** believe God has built into us (in our DNA? In our brains?) the desire to seek Him out in our lifetime.  But if we do not respond to that, are we condemned after this life is over.

If so, then that leaves the majority of humanity without God in the afterlife.
